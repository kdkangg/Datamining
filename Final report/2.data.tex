\section{Profile of a data set}
The explored data set consists of traditional lifelogging data and sports activity logging data which has been collected by using Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch wristband, the PMSys sports logging application, and forms in Google. The data has been gathered within 5 months (from November 2019 to March 2020) and contains information about 16 people on the age scale 25 - 60 years and with a mean value of the age of 34 years. Furthermore, during the collection of the data, the participants have been advised to do exercises at least twice per week (without any particular restrictions on exercises or their duration). The range of people's experience in sports is from participants who do exercises rare to active athletes.

The structure of explored data set is placed below in Figure 1. Moreover, parts from different resources are highlighted with various colors which depend on the place where the data has been stored:
