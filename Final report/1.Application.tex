\section{Application area and goals}
Nowadays many people cannot imagine their lives without digital technologies. This kind of technology allows people to store their data which are related not only to their leisure time, but also to their health. The information about people's condition is stored by different gadgets or/and applications. This kind of data is used for maintaining people's health by aforementioned technologies. Moreover, these days people prefer caring about their health by doing sports. In order to control their condition daily or/and during trains people  wear smartwatches. These devices not only store data, but also are able to predict some of them for a future day/days. Based on data from such devices, we would like to predict people's readiness to work out for upcoming day. This characteristic is of great importance for people, since in most cases they assess their readiness for sports based on their current feelings which are connected with previous days condition. The goal of this project is to find out the best classification model for prediction readiness of a person based on data for preceding days. We have decided to explore classification approaches due to the fact that attribute "readiness" in using data is assessed in the range 0 - 10, where 0 is assigned to a person whom isn't ready to do sports for upcoming day and 10 is assigned to a person whom is ready for extra work out for upcoming day.
