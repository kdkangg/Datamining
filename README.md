# Daily Readiness score prediction with Health data 

### Datamining FS2022 Team6
As interest in healthy lifestyles has increased, gadgets and apps for storing health have become more popular. Wearing a smartwatch or fitness tracker to digitally record your life is a common way to do this. Life-logging is an activity that helps people monitor their activity to maintain a healthier lifestyle. Most life log data is stored privately, so individuals cannot easily access it. As a result of the efforts of Thambawati et al (2020), various analyses of this data have become possible.
Taking this opportunity, we would like to predict how 'prepared' people will be for the day ahead. A person's readiness to exercise can be influenced by the actions and conditions of the previous day. Based on data from the previous day, this project aimed to predict a person's readiness. As the target attribute 'readiness' was stored on a discrete range from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates someone is not ready for exercise on the upcoming day and 10 indicates someone is ready to do additional work, we decided to investigate classification methods.
